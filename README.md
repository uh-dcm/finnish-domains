# Classification of Finnish domains

This dataset originates from link sharing of Finnish online communities on migration-related discussions.
We have classified most popular domains to following categories:

* Media

  Sites from journalistic organizations that have salaried staff. The Web site is often complementary to other forms of distributing news,
  such as a newspaper or broadcasts (e.g., radio), but this is not mandatory.
  This corresponds to [Jacobson’s](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2015.1064461) "mainstream media".

  | Subcategory | Examples |
  |---|---|
  | National media Journalistic products with national or otherwise general-interest focus within Finland. | hs.fi |
  | Local media Journalistic products that have more explicit regional focus within Finland. | sss.fi |
  | Organization media Journalistic products published by a Finnish organization – e.g., a membership, employee, or stakeholder magazine. | seurakuntalainen.fi |
  | Political party media Journalistic products published by a Finnish political party. | vihrealanka.fi |
  | International media Journalistic products published outside Finland. Note that these are not more explicitly classified as national, local, organizational, and political groups’ but, rather, represent all internationally focused media. | aftonbladet.se |
  
* Newslike site

  Sites that publish news-like content in a format that resembles media but where the factuality of the content is questionable.
  This includes clickbait sites, media sites that provide non-factual information, "alternative media" sites, and "fake news" sites.
  It partially corresponds to "humour" in [Jacobson](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2015.1064461).
  
  | Subcategory | Examples |
  |---|---|
  | (no subcategories) | breitbart.com; mvlehti.net |
  
* Non-governmental organizations

  Sites run by non-governmental or non-profit organizations.
  This corresponds to [Jacobson’s](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2015.1064461) "NGO" with the exception of including political organizations also.
  
  | Subcategory | Examples |
  |---|---|
  | Finnish NGO Non-profit organizations operating mainly in Finland or operating with money from Finnish citizens and organizations. | spr.fi |
  | Finnish social movement Social movements and issue-based "organizations" not organized as well as the non-governmental organizations. This class also involves causes, often related to the topic of migration. | refugees-welcome.fi |
  | Finnish political party Parties on the Finnish Ministry of Justice’s list of parties (this is the definition of a political party in Finnish law) and affiliated party organizations. | kokoomus.fi |
  | International organization Non-profit organizations operating mainly outside Finland | hrw.org |
  | International social movement Social movements and causes operating outside Finland. | anonhq.com |
  | International political party Political parties in some other country. | ?? |
  
 * Governmental organizations
 
    Any local, national, international, or multilevel government-operated organizations.
    This corresponds to [Jacobson’s](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2015.1064461) "government organisational" [27].
    
   | Subcategory | Examples |

   | Finnish governmental organization Organizations governing the citizens within Finland or providing the Finnish government with support Finnish parliament, Ministry of Justice, City of services to conduct such work. | eduskunta.fi |
   | International governmental organization Organizations similar to Finnish governmental organizations but run by countries other than Finland. | police.uk |
   | Multilevel governmental organization Governing organizations working on a level above the national state. These work in multinational collaboration on topics such as legislation, defense, and policy-making | ?? |

# Can I use this dataset?

Yes. However, remember that it is already fairly old and the domains were found on discussions in a spesific societal issue.
So this is not a representative classification of all domains.

# Can I build and extend on this classification.

Yes. We are happy to accept pull requests to expand, update or change categories using the above-formulated classess.

We have licensed the work so that all derivative work **must** be shared with the same license.
Therefore, if you modify this categorisations we really like if you can share it with us.
